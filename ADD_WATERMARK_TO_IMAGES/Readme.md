<h1> Automatically add watermark to your pictures </h1>

<p> You can simply add your watermark to many pictures you want by few clicks. Just place images into created folder that you will specify in the code, then upload watermark image there and run it. <br> By default the position of the watermark is bottom right corner because it is calculated. But you can change that too. </p>

<p> Also be aware that it may not work for you as good as for me. This code was my personal project and i am using this on every photo i own. Its very usefull ðŸ˜„ </p>
