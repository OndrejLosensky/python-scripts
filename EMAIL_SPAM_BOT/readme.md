<h1> Script for sending hundreds of e-mails </h1>

<p> This is automatical e-mail sender script. You will log to your email address with google app passwords as in my previous scripts. <br> Then you can specify one address you want to send multiple emails to or you can send some kind of like batches to emails from database/Excel file/csv or text file. This script runs until you stop it, you can also edit the time between it sends another email. </p>
