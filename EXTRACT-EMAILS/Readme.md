  # **EXTRACT EMAILS TO EXCEL** #
  
  This is simple Python projects, that will access your gmail and then it will read all emails, check then as SEEN and then i creates an Excel file. 
  In this file the script will create table with content of your e-mail. There will be BODY, SUBJECT, FROM, TO, DATE, Unique ID and NUMBER. Then it saves to
  the given PATH. IF you want to use this program for your usage, you can. Additionally I recommend you to set the script to run automatically for example every week
  you can achieve this by using 'filename.sh' file on Linux-based OS, or via 'filename.bat' on Windows. REMEMBER YOU NEED TO HAVE INSTALLED ALL THE LIBRARIES THAT IT USES!!

  Also if you want to just read emails automatically, just use my second script, which is in other repo thats PINned on my profile ðŸ“Œ

    You will need all those libraries:

```bash
  pip install xlsxwriter
  pip install imaplib
  pip install email
  pip install time
  pip install yaml

  Then you need to have folder thats called **Excel_folder**
