<h1> Get name of today's day! </h1>
<p> By using this script, you can easily get the name of the day thats today. </p>
<p> You can change the names of the days to your language for your usage </p>
<p> I'am using this in many of my projects where i for example need to log current day in this format and then re-use it. </p>

<h6> You can adjust the format as you desire! </h6>
