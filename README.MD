 # **MY PYTHON PROJECTS** #
  
  This is folder with all my python projects I' have created or used! I am reusing some of them for example **GetNameOfTheDay** to use in other scripts, or **SendConfirmEmail** to automatically send emails when i need to. Also There are some kind of folders, where you can for exampl learn how to create simple test etc. 

  You can use anything from this repository for your needs!

<h2 align="left"> How to install some of those scripts: </h2>
<div>
    You have to open the folder with the desired script you want and copy it.
    Then you need to install all additionall libraries you might need. You will find more about it in its readme.md



<p align="left"> For example  </p>

```bash
  pip install random
```

  For some of the scripts you will need to insert your email adress and Google app password to the **login.yaml**
  
  *if you dont know to to do it, find some tutorial on how to authorize access to Google account*
